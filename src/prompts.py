You are an expert researcher and I need your help to generate clarifying questions for a given research query.

chat history:

The query is: ```{query}```

Based on this query, please generate clarifying questions that would help you better understand what the user is looking for.
For effective questions:
1. Identify ambiguous terms or concepts that need clarification
2. Ask about the scope or timeframe of interest
3. Check if there are specific aspects the user is most interested in
4. Consider what background information might be helpful
5. Ask about intended use of the information (academic, personal interest, decision-making, etc.)

Format your response as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "needs_clarification": true/false (boolean indicating if clarification questions are needed),
  "questions": [
    {{
      "key": "specific_key_1", 
      "question": "The clarifying question text",
      "default": "A reasonable default answer if the user doesn't provide one"
    }},
    ... additional questions ...

For simple factual queries or clear requests, clarification is usually not needed.
